    <h2>Who are Vikings ?</h2>

    <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>Vikings is the modern name given to seafaring people primarily from Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden), who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of Europe.</li>
        <li> They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and North America.</li>
        <li>In some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term "Viking" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a collective whole.</li>
        <li>The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia.</li>
        <li>Expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, the Baltic coast, and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in what is now European Russia, Belarus and Ukraine (where they were also known as Varangians). </li>
